<p><img src="assets/family_sunset.jpg" alt="Family on a sunset cruise" width="350" height="235" class="img_left_float" /><span class="body_text">We have many activities for you to choose from, here at the  resort and in the surrounding area. </span></p>
<p class="body_text">Some of our visitors enjoy deep-sea fishing trips. We have a  small fleet of boats that will take you out for either a half or a full day. One of our most popular trips leaves late in the afternoon and stays out long enough to take in a beautiful Florida sunset on the way home. Of course,   you can also surf cast, right from the beach.</p>
<p><img src="assets/two_dolphins.jpg" alt="Two dolphins surfing the wake" width="350" height="219" class="img_right_float" /><span class="body_text">And don&rsquo;t forget our dolphin cruises. We have a unique  approach &mdash; two boats speed along, side by side, about 50 yards apart. The  dolphins love it because it generates a huge wake. You'll see them jumping  right between the boats! You can arrange for tickets for <a href="fishing.html">fishing excursions</a> or <a href="cruises.html">dolphin cruises</a> at The Club House desk.</span></p>
